# C++ Keywords

### *Keywords are reserved words which have a predefined/special meaning within the language hence they cannot be redefined for other purposes.Ex- int,float,double,cout,cin,endl.*

#### ‚ùÑ Below code shows us some basic keywords in C++ :-

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int id=2095;//int for storing integers,whole numbers.
    double marks=195.259;//double for storing decimals upto a larger precision.
    std::string name="John";//string for storing a sequence of characters.

    std::cout<<"The name is: "<<name<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
